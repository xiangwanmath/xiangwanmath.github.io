I'm an assistant professor in the [Linguistics Department](https://www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the [Child Language Lab](http://childlanglab.com/). 

I teach graduate seminars in [psycholinguistics](/ling607) and [neurolinguistics](/neurolinguistics) and an undergraduate course in [language and the brain](/ling104). Occasionally, I also teach [LING 1](/ling001), Penn's Introduction to Linguistics.

This semester I'm teaching a new undergraduate course (with Colin Twomey): [Data Science for Studying Language and the Mind](/ling172).
