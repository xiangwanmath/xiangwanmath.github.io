I'm a mathematician with research interests in Partial Differential Equations and related Control Theory, Math Modeling, and Numerical Analysis. 

Since Fall 2022, I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.luc.edu/math/index.shtml), [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/). 
Previously, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/mathematics-and-statistics), at [the George Washington University](https://math.columbian.gwu.edu/), and a Research Assistant Professor at [Wayne State University](https://clas.wayne.edu/math).

I received my Ph.D in Mathematics in 2017 from [the University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Irena Lasiecka](https://math.virginia.edu/people/il2v/).

My research has been partially supported by the [College of Arts and Sciences](https://www.luc.edu/cas/), by the [Office of the Provost](https://www.luc.edu/academicaffairs/index.shtml), and by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/).

I help organize the [Analysis Seminar](https://fermat.math.luc.edu/analysis_seminar/) at Loyola and serve as the co-advisor of the LUC SIAM Student Chapter. See more information about the chapter [here](https://loyolachicagosiam.github.io/).
