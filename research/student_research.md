Interested in doing math research with me? I always welcome students with a few key qualities: **curiosity**, **critical thinking**, **persistence**, and **attention to details**. 
Your current stage of mathematical study comes next; I am interested in working with students at different levels. 

My past work with students were in various formats, including research projects, independent study (courses), reading courses:

- Research Projects
  
  Loyola has established programs that aim on promoting undergraduate research. Check out the [LUROP website](https://www.luc.edu/celts/programs/undergraduateresearch/) and read the website through. It contains a lot of useful information.

- Seminar Courses
  
  MATH 298 (1 credit, run every Spring) and MATH 390 (2 credits, run every Spring) are dedicated to students' work in research. They are both approved **Engaged Learning** courses with 3 credits togather and meet the Loyola's EL requirement.
  
  See examples of their syllabi [here](https://loyolauniversitychicago-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xwan1_luc_edu/EmLEoqdNFG5GoQP56-2v0sgB_UWlK9cDdbK2Jr9BELW6GA).

- Independent Study
  
  This is for advanced students who are interested in learning beyond standard curricular offered at Loyola. The 
  - MATH 395/495
    - TBD, Fall 2025
  - COMP 495
    - PDE Methods in Image Processing, Spring 2025

- Reading Courses

  The topics should be about advanced materials. A few that I have mentored at Loyola:
  - [Functional Analysis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dtdrczdwrbnt#79c706)
  - [Pointset Topology and Analysis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/thmjyvvtcffc#7268f6)


If you are still interested this far, feel free to contact me **with questions**, either via an email or stop by during my open office hours.

- [CAURS](https://www.caurs.com/) (annually, often in early-mid April)
- Joint Math Meetings (annually, often in early January; largest gathering of mathematicians in the United States, and the largest annual meeting of mathematicians in the world)

### External Opportunities

Several of my past students have successfully obtained Summer REUs. Here are a few places as examples:
- [Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli)
- [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program-grfp)
- [IIT Summer REU 'SURE'](https://www.iit.edu/computing/research/student-research/SURE)
