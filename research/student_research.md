Interested in doing math research with me? I always welcome students with a few key qualities: curiosity, critical thinking, persistence, and attention to details. 

I worked with students in various formats, including research projects, independent study (courses), reading courses.

### Research Projects
Loyola has established programs that aim on promoting undergraduate research. Check out the [LUROP website](https://www.luc.edu/celts/programs/undergraduateresearch/) and read the website through. It contains a lot of useful information.

Some past projects I mentored:
