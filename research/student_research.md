Interested in doing math research with me? I always welcome students with a few key qualities: curiosity, critical thinking, persistence, and attention to details. 

I worked with students in various formats, including research projects, independent study (courses), reading courses.

### Research Projects
Loyola has established programs that aim on promoting undergraduate research. Check out the [LUROP website](https://www.luc.edu/celts/programs/undergraduateresearch/) and read the website through. It contains a lot of useful information.

Some past projects I mentored:

### Seminar Courses
MATH 298 (1 credit, run every Spring) and MATH 390 (2 credits, run every Spring) are dedicated to students' work in research. They are both approved **Engaged Learning** courses with 3 credits togather and meet the Loyola's EL requirement.

### Independent Study
This is for advanced students who are interested in learning beyond standard curricular offered at Loyola. The 
- MATH 395/495
  - TBD, Fall 2025
- COMP 495
  - PDE Methods in Image Processing, Spring 2025

### Reading Courses
- [Functional Analysis](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dtdrczdwrbnt#79c706)
- Pointset Topology and Analysis
