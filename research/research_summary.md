    We study an initial–boundary-value problem for a quasilinear thermoelastic plate of Kirchhoff & Love-type with parabolic heat conduction due to Fourier, mechanically simply supported and held at the reference temperature on the boundary. For this problem, we show the short-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions under appropriate regularity and compatibility assumptions on the data. Further, we use barrier techniques to prove the global existence and exponential stability of solutions under a smallness condition on the initial data. It is the first result of this kind established for a quasilinear non-parabolic thermoelastic Kirchhoff & Love plate in multiple dimension.

    We consider an initial–boundary-value problem for a thermoelastic Kirchhoff & Love plate, thermally insulated and simply supported on the boundary, incorporating rotational inertia and a quasilinear hypoelastic response, while the heat effects are modeled using the hyperbolic Maxwell–Cattaneo–Vernotte law giving rise to a ‘second sound’ effect. We study the local well-posedness of the resulting quasilinear mixed-order hyperbolic system in a suitable solution class of smooth functions mapping into Sobolev -spaces. Exploiting the sole source of energy dissipation entering the system through the hyperbolic heat flux moment, provided the initial data are small – not in the full topology of our solution class, but in a lower topology corresponding to weak solutions we prove a nonlinear stabilizability estimate furnishing global existence & uniqueness and exponential decay of classical solutions.
