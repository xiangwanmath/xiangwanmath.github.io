#### 3. Let a job run in the background
1.  After you SSH into the server, just run `screen`. That will take you into a background terminal/session, where one can run a process (without finishing).
2. Then to disconnect, press/type `CTRL+A+D`. That will disconnect you from the current session, but everything still run. 
3. To connect back into the sessions, type `screen -r`. If you have multiple sessions, then when you type in `screen -r`, you will see the list of them. In that case you can type in `screen -r <PID Number>` to connect.
4. Type `exit` to quit the current session.
