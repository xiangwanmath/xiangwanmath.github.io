### $$\LaTeX$$ Tutorials
$$\LaTeX$$ is a typesetting system widely used for document preparation, particularly in mathematics, science, engineering, and academia. It is designed to produce high-quality, professional-looking documents, especially those containing complex mathematical equations, technical diagrams, and structured content. 

Compared to standard word processors (such as Word), $$\LaTeX$$ is:
- **a high-quality typesetting system:** Produces professional, publication-ready documents.  
- **well-suited for mathematics:** Handles complex equations and symbols effortlessly.  
- **capable of precise layout control:** Fine-tunes spacing, margins, and formatting.  
- **designed with separation of content and style:** Focus on writing while styles are controlled by templates (preambles).
- **structured and automated:** Manages sections, cross-references, and numbering.  
- **integrated with bibliography tools:** It works with `BibTeX` or `biblatex` for automatic referencing.
- **an industrial and academic standard:** Many scientific journals and conferences only accept $$\LaTeX$$ submissions.  
- **version control friendly:** Works well with `Git` and other collaborative tools.  

Last but not least, only in recent years has the rendering of math expressions on webpages become increasingly based on $$\LaTeX$$ and related technologies. The math expressions on this website are rendered by $$\KaTeX$$.
